# Dustbike 2019

Project to put some custom lights on my crappy playa bike. 

* Side lights are APA102 strings. 
* Floods are Amazon-sourced (lol it's all Alibaba now) motorcycle floods.
* Tails are some little RGB led bar with integrated PBM driver. 

I'll put a BOM up soon unless I don't. 

Controller is a [Nucleo-L432KC|https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/NUCLEO-L432KC/497-16592-ND/6132763/?itemSeq=297939740], because it was $11.
